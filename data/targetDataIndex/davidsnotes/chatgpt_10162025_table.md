| **1970–1981 (Great Inflation)**  | 1970, 1973, 1980, 1981 | Red line collapses toward zero almost immediately        | Pre-recession inflationary shocks would destabilize post-Volcker regimes. The economy shifted from fiscal-demand-led growth to tight-money contraction; inflation expectations were “purged.”            |
| **1990–2001 (Great Moderation)** | 1990, 2001             | Red line low but *stable*, hovering far below actual GDP | Monetary policy became rule-based (Taylor-rule consistency). The transmission of old shocks no longer caused runaway inflation or deep contractions, but potential output rose steadily.                 |
| **2008 (Financial Crisis)**      | 2008                   | Red line *soars above* the actual blue line              | Post-2008 dynamics inverted the transmission channel: old-regime (credit-expansion) shocks would have generated massive booms under ZLB conditions. The new regime is liquidity-trapped and over-damped. |
