#TODO: [] we need to create a map of all the data centers because I believe that the way we can see how the different areas are segmented. I saw on anthropic economic index that washington dc was first and utah was second. i wonder if that is inclusive of the surrounding regions and feeding more rural space density into those singular data centers.
/n Todo list: [x] get the data from Anthropic Hugging face after logging into huggingface command line.
[] reorganize the data to find out how to put it into FRED like data/n
